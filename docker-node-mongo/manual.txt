dockerize node+mongo server

git init

git clone https://github.com/bradtraversy/docker-node-mongo.git

create Dockerfile

    FROM node:10 mean to fix version for stability

    WORKDIR /usr/src/app mean as mention in node container 

    COPY package*.json ./ mean copy all package*.json to replace all package*.json in defalut WORKDIR

    RUN npm install mean afterthat install modules in WORKDIR

    COPY . .  mean copy from all file such as model,view,index,manual.txt 

    EXPOSE 3000 mean port of container

    CMD ["npm", "start"] mean ask container to launch npm start when docker container run



create docker-compose to create image of  mongo + node app  at the same time

version: '3'
services:
  app:
    container_name: docker-node-mongo
    restart: always
    build: .       mean we build this image from Dockerfile (node)
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    links:
      - mongo
  mongo:
    container_name: mongo    mean  for mogoose.connect('mongodb://mongo:27017/docker-node-mongo') in index.js
    restart: always
    image: mongo             mean we just load image mongo from dockerhub
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'        mean mongo defalut ports


To run docker-compose
docker-compose up -d mean this command up = build(image)+up --no-start(container)+start(run container)+in background


To check container
docker container ls -a

To see what inside app
docker container exec -it dockernodemongo_app bash
ls -a
.   .dockerignore  .gitignore  README.md	   index.js    models	     package-lock.json	views
..  .git	   Dockerfile  docker-compose.yml  manual.txt  node_modules  package.json

check port
htop
tcp6       0      0 :::3000                 :::*                    LISTEN     
tcp6       0      0 :::27017                :::*                    LISTEN 

dock-compose down mean stop and 

exit

------------------------------------------
next step is to push on digital ocean droplist/server

https://m.do.co/c/5424d440c63a

at our machine (client)
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa mean to add private key for connect with public key at server
and copy key to digitalOcean

login digitalOcean with github user account (or create new account)
need credit card information but not charge until upload app
select ubuntu+One-click apps(Docker)
or ubuntu (and install docker yourself)
choose package 5 $ /month 
add new SSH key past the above key from client
change host name of droplist(if need)
link rigisted domain (if have) with ip address from digitalOcean
copy ip address

at our machine(client)
ssh root@ipaddress
you can access server from our machine (client)

at server digitalOcean
create ssh key to clone (connect to) github-respo
ssh-keygen mean to use simple one or ssh-keygen -t rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mean to copy public key for github

at github at user profile (under our image) 
select Settings 
select SSH and GPG keys
past public key from digital ocean server

at server digitalOcean
git clone "put app respository here"
now we get app "docker-node-mongo" on server
cd docker-node-mongo
docker-compose up -d mean to run container in background on server
