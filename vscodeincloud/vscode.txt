User VScode in cloud to make it easy to 
use high speed server capacity
to develop project and test project
(cloud server=vultr.com, digitalocean.com, aws.amazon.com)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Emn2YQNDl0

This project use cloud-server "vultr"
https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7992714-4F

User vscode on server
https://github.com/codercom/code-server
we can run vscode on server with docker
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8443:8443 -v "${PWD}:/home/coder/project" codercom/code-server --allow-http --no-auth
or 


at server (vult.com)
login
server>display new server
servertype>ubutu
server size>$10/month
ssh key>add new
server hostname > use what you want
deploy now
install...........take some minute

at our machine(client)   >> see how to set up ssh above
ssh root@ipaddress

at github
click code server by download binary(zip) file from https://github.com/cdr/code-server
select
code-server1.1156-vsc1.33.1-linux-x64.tar.gz (zip) right click and copy link address

at server (vult.com)
wget https://github.com/cdr/code-server/releases/download/1.1156-vsc1.33.1/code-server1.1156-vsc1.33.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
tar xvfz code-server1.1156-vsc1.33.1-linux-x64.tar.gz mean upzipfile (extract)
cd code-server1.1156-vsc1.33.1-linux-x64

ls
code-server LICENSE README.md
mv code-server /bin   mean to move this command to bin in order to run vs from any whare in server

mkdir myapp mean to create folder app
cd myapp    mean go to myapp folder
code-server mean to run vscode in myapp folder

vscode will be run on localhost:8443/


at chrome our machine(client) 
ipaddres:8443     mean type this address to use code-server
at first error page (because chrome is set for https only)
click advance
click proceed  
put password given when install code-server (to prevent outsider to edit our server file )

use code-server 
you can install theme, extension,live-server,
install latest nodes in server
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
apt install nodejs    mean we use app install because already have file in machine from curl


===========================================================
Generate a self-signed certificate
https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/master/doc/security/ssl.md

concept
We need a certified server to ensure not fishing site
We need to encrypt information before sending to server

How it work
1. generate private key (normally this belong to cirtify body)
2. generate certificate request + detail information (this belong to our website)
3. signed certificate + key + expire date (this signed by cetify body and send to our website) 

at server
1) creqte https key (ssl) 
mkdir ~/certs && cd ~/certs
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ~/certs/MyKey.key -out ~/certs/MyCertificate.crt

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

-----
2. create certificate request 
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US     
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:TX
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Austin
Organization Name (eg, company) [Coder Technologies]:Coder
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Docs
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:hostname.example.com
Email Address []:admin@example.com

2) go to server 
At the end of the path to your binary, add the following flags followed by the path to your certificate 
and key like so. Then press enter to run code-server. 

./code-server --cert=~/certs/MyCertificate.crt --cert-key=~/certs/MyKey.key
